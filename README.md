About the test project.
 
Please build a simple 'connect four' game and host it on your site.

what it is is that the winner of the game must be able to connect four dots of the same color diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.
 
The task would be as follow
1. when the first user goes to the website, the site prompts the user, how many rows and columns of the board of the game?
2. Once the user1 enters the value, for example, 7 rows and 6 columns, then the site would build the board
3. user1 then waits for user2 to enter
4. once user2 enter, user1 starts the game by placing one piece (use color red for user1 and black for user2)
5. the game ends when one of the user finish connecting all 4 dots OR when the board is full with the pieces but no one is able to connect four dots
6. user1 and user2 will be prompt winner or loser (depending on who win the game) or board is full, no winner, when the board is full
7. to restart the game, you can either click refresh on the browser or a reset button (whichever is easier for you to build).  then the process restarts to step 1 again.
 
This task should take about 2-3 hours to build. 
 
Please share me the source code once you finish it.
 
Thanks.
